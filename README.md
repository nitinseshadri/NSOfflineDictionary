As this cannot be published on the App Store due to Apple's SDK stating that UIReferenceLibraryViewController "should not be used to display wordlists, create a standalone dictionary app, or republish the content in any form," I am releasing it here as an open-source project for personal, non-commercial, educational use only. You are not permitted to reuse this code in your own applications.

To use the app, download or clone this repository onto your iPad and open the .swiftpm project with Swift Playgrounds. To use the app on iPhone, build the .swiftpm project with Xcode on your Mac.

## Features

* Search for words in the dictionary
* View and manage recent searches
